## Task Completion Guidelines

### For Each Task:
- [ ] **Code Implementation**: Write clean, well-documented code
- [ ] **Testing**: Basic functionality testing completed
- [ ] **UI/UX Review**: Interface elements match design specifications
- [ ] **Performance Check**: No significant performance regressions
- [ ] **Documentation**: Code is documented, README updated if needed

### Dependencies:
- Tasks should be completed in order (1→2→3...)
- Some tasks can be worked on in parallel once dependencies are met
- Frontend tasks (1-30) can proceed without backend authentication initially
- Backend integration (31-40) requires completed frontend foundation
